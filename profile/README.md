# Nexchain

## üôå Overview
Nexchain is a blockchain protocol that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance scalability, security, and interoperability. It employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with AI-driven optimizations, allowing for adaptive transaction validation and network management. The system supports high transaction throughput through sharding and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), reducing network congestion and improving efficiency. The platform incorporates AI-enhanced smart contracts capable of self-optimization and decision-making based on predefined parameters. Cross-chain interoperability is facilitated through bridging protocols that enable asset transfers and communication between different blockchain networks. AI is further used to optimize governance mechanisms, detect fraudulent activity, and predict network congestion. Nexchain follows an inflationary token model with an annual burning mechanism to regulate supply. The token is used for transaction fees, staking rewards, and governance participation. The presale phase aims to raise $90.6 million, representing 32% of the total token supply. Security features include post-quantum cryptography, AI-driven anomaly detection, and self-healing mechanisms that isolate malfunctioning nodes. The protocol is designed to support applications in finance, supply chain management, healthcare, IoT, and decentralized AI services. 

The development roadmap includes a phased implementation, beginning with the presale and initial launch, followed by the deployment of developer tools, scalability enhancements, and full ecosystem expansion. Nexchain provides an infrastructure for blockchain applications requiring high efficiency, automation, and adaptability to evolving computational demands.

## üìä Tokenomics
Nexchain‚Äôs tokenomics model is structured to support network security, incentivize participation, and sustain long-term value through controlled issuance and strategic allocation. The total initial supply of Nexchain tokens is 2,150,000,000, distributed across various categories, including early-stage investment rounds, ecosystem incentives, staking rewards, and liquidity provisioning. Nexchain employs an inflationary issuance model with an annual burn mechanism to regulate supply while ensuring continued token utility.



### Token Supply
